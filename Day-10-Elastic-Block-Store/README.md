# ☁ Day 09 - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)

## Objective

To understand Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), learn how to create and attach EBS volumes to EC2 instances, and create snapshots for backup and recovery.

---

# What is Amazon EBS?

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-level storage service that provides persistent storage for Amazon EC2 instances.

Unlike the instance store, EBS volumes retain data even if the EC2 instance is stopped.

---

# Features of Amazon EBS

* Persistent block storage
* High durability and availability
* Easy to resize volumes
* Supports encryption
* Backup using Snapshots
* Can be attached and detached from EC2 instances

---

# Types of EBS Volumes

## 1. General Purpose SSD (gp3)

* Most commonly used
* Suitable for web servers and development environments
* Balanced performance and cost

---

## 2. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)

* High-performance storage
* Designed for mission-critical databases

---

## 3. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)

* Suitable for large, sequential workloads
* Used for big data and log processing

---

## 4. Cold HDD (sc1)

* Low-cost storage
* Used for infrequently accessed data

---

# What is an EBS Snapshot?

An EBS Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an EBS volume.

Snapshots are stored in Amazon S3 (managed internally by AWS) and can be used to:

* Restore lost data
* Create new EBS volumes
* Backup critical information

---

# Practical Performed

## Step 1: Create an EBS Volume

Navigate to:

EC2 → Elastic Block Store → Volumes

Configuration:

* Volume Type: gp3
* Size: 10 GB
* Availability Zone: Same as EC2 Instance

---

## Step 2: Attach Volume

Select the created volume.

Click:

Actions → Attach Volume

Choose the running EC2 instance.

Example Device Name:

```text
/dev/nvmw1n1
```

---

## Step 3: Verify the Volume

Connect to the EC2 instance and verify the new disk:

```bash
lsblk
```

Expected output:

```text
nvme1n1      259:5    0    9G  0 disk 
```

---

## Step 4: List the disk partition on the system:

```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

---

## Step 5: Check the file system:

```bash
sudo file -s /dev/nvme1n1
```

---

## Step 6: If the output is data, then create the file system:

```bash
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nvme1n1
```

## Step 7: Recheck the file system:

```bash
sudo file -s /dev/nvme1n1
```

---

## Step 8: Create a mount point directory for the volume:

```bash
sudo mkdir /mydata
```

## Step 9: Mount the volume:

```bash
sudo mount /dev/nvme1n1 /mydata
```

## Step 10: Run df -h to view the data: 

```bash
df -h
```

Navigate to:

EC2 → Volumes

Select the volume.

Click:

Actions → Create Snapshot

Provide a name and description.

Create the snapshot.

---

# Practical Outcome

✅ Created an EBS Volume.

✅ Attached the volume to an EC2 instance.

✅ Formatted and mounted the volume.

✅ Verified the mounted storage.

✅ Created an EBS Snapshot for backup.

---

# Advantages of EBS

* Persistent storage
* High availability
* Easy backup using snapshots
* Data survives EC2 stop/start
* Supports encryption
* Can increase storage without replacing the instance

---

# Key Learnings

* Learned the purpose of Amazon EBS.
* Understood different EBS volume types.
* Attached storage to an EC2 instance.
* Mounted a new volume in Linux.
* Created an EBS Snapshot.

# Interview Questions

### What is Amazon EBS?

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a persistent block storage service for Amazon EC2 instances.

---

### Is EBS persistent?

Yes. Data stored in an EBS volume remains even if the EC2 instance is stopped.

---

### What is an EBS Snapshot?

An EBS Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an EBS volume.

---

### Can one EBS volume be attached to multiple EC2 instances?

Generally, an EBS volume can be attached to only one EC2 instance at a time (with some specialized Multi-Attach exceptions for supported volume types).

---

### Difference between EBS and S3

| Amazon EBS      | Amazon S3                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Block Storage   | Object Storage                  |
| Attached to EC2 | Standalone Storage              |
| Used as a Disk  | Used to Store Files and Objects |
